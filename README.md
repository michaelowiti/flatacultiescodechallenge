Core Deliverables:
As a user, I can:

See a list of all animal names. You will need to make a GET request to the  endpoint to retrieve the  character data

Click on an animal’s name to see its details i.e image and number of votes. Note, you should only be displaying the details of one animal at a time. You can either use the character information from your first request or make a new request to this endpoint to get the character's details 

 When viewing an animal’s details, I should be able to add the number of votes for each animal. This number of votes should then be displayed together with the animal’s details. No persistence is needed for the votes.
